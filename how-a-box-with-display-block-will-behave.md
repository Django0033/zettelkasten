# How a box with display block will behave?
- It will break onto a new line.
- The `width` and `height` properties are respected.
- Padding, margin and border will cause other elements to be pushed away from
    it.
- If `width` is not specified, it will extend in the inline direction to fill
    the space available in its container.
