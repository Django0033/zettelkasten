#What is a Set in Python
It's a data type used to store several items in a single variable. The
difference between a set and a list is that a set cannot have multiple
occurrences of the same element and store unordered values.

```python
set_example = {'Eleazar','Dj',True,1.8}

print(set_example)
#The next line will throw an error since a set has no order
print(set_example[0])
```
