# What is a complex number?
A complex number is a number that is composed of two parts: a real part and an
imaginary part. The real part is simply a number that we are familiar with in
our daily lives, such as 2, 3, or 5. The imaginary part is represented by the
letter "i" and is used to express numbers that do not have a real square root,
such as the square root of -1.

For example, if we have the complex number "3 + 2i", the real part is 3 and the
imaginary part is 2i. Or if we have the complex number "2i", the real part is 0
and the imaginary part is 2i.

Complex numbers are used in many fields of mathematics and physics, and have
some interesting properties. For example, complex numbers can be added,
subtracted, multiplied, and divided just like the real numbers we are used to
using. Additionally, complex numbers can be represented on a plane called the
"complex plane," where the real part is represented on the horizontal axis and
the imaginary part on the vertical axis.
