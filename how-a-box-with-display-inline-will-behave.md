# How a box with display inline will behave
- It will not break onto a new line.
- the `width` and `height` properties will not apply.
- Vertical padding, margins, and borders will apply but will not cause other
    inline boxes to move away from it.
- Horizontal padding, margins, and borders will apply and will cause other
    inline boxes to move away from it.
