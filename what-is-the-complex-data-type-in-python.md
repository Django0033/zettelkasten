# What is the complex data type in python?
A complex number is a number that has an imaginary part that doesn't have a real
square root. In python the imaginary part is written with a "j".

```python
x = 3+5j
y = 5j
z = -5j

print(type(x)) # <class 'complex'>
print(type(y)) # <class 'complex'>
print(type(z)) # <class 'complex'>
```
