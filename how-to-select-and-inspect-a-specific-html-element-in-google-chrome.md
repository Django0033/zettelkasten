# How to select and inspect a specific HTML element in Google Chrome

Open the inspector. In the Elements pane, you can see the entire HTML structure
of your page. You can click on any of the elements in this pane to select that
specific element. Alternatively, you can click the blue-highlighted icon shown
in the top left corner, and hover over any element on the page.

When an element is selected, the Styles tab will show all the currently applied
styles, as well as any styles that are being overwritten (indicated by a
strikethrough of the text).
