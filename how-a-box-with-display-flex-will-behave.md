# How a box with display flex will behave?
- It will become a flex container.
- Its children will become flex items.
- Flex items will be arranged in a row or a column depending on the value of the
    `flex-direction` property.
- Flex items will try to stretch to fill the available space.
- The alignment of the flex items can be control using the `justify-content` and
    `align-items` properties.
- Flex items can be reordered using the `order` property.
