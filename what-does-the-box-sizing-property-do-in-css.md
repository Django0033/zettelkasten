# What does the `box-sizing` property do in CSS?
It sets how the total width and height of an element is calculated, including
its padding and border. `box-sizing: content-box`

```CSS
box-sizing: content-box;  <!-- width and height only include the content -->
box-box: content-box;  <!-- width and height include the content, padding, and border. -->
```
